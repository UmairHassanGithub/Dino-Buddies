# Dino-Buddies
Group project, social media software mockup.
By William Chan, Umair Hassan, Bryan Huynh, Aidan Kelly, Brandon Lu, and Sodienye Nkwonta.
The purpose of the project was to make an application that can be used by students to find other students that share similar interests to them. 
Wanted to base this project on the University of Calgary, 
and decided that an application that can help connect students together would make a more interconnected school community.
